# Prompt for Training ChatGPT to Write in Your Voice

I want to train you to write like me by providing samples of my previous work and analyzing their characteristics. My objective is to create a tailored writing assistant that mimics my unique voice, tone, and style across various contexts. Here's what I need from you:

1. **Analyze My Writing Samples**:  
   I will share examples of my writing. Analyze these to identify key characteristics of my writing voice, including:  
   - **Tone**: Is it formal, informal, light-hearted, serious, persuasive, etc.?  
   - **Style**: Note sentence structures, vocabulary choices, rhythm, and any distinct patterns.  
   - **Distinctive Traits**: Identify any unique elements, such as specific phrases, perspectives, or stylistic preferences.  

   Provide a detailed summary of these characteristics so I can refine how you interpret my voice.

2. **Describe My Voice and Style**:  
   Based on your analysis, articulate the essence of my writing voice. Break this down into tone, diction, rhythm, sentence structure, and anything else notable.

3. **Write Original Content in My Voice**:  
   Using the analysis, generate new content in my voice. For example:  
   - Write a blog post introducing a specific topic.  
   - Rewrite the following content for a specific audience, adapting the tone and terminology while maintaining my voice.  
   - Format and structure the content I provide to match a particular template or style from my samples.

4. **Adapt My Voice Across Formats and Platforms**:  
   Create tailored content for various platforms while preserving my writing voice. For example:  
   - Create a social media caption that reflects my voice.  
   - Reformat a blog post for an email newsletter or Medium article.  
   - Adjust content for different audiences, such as entrepreneurs, students, or professionals.

5. **Provide Feedback and Refinements**:  
   After generating each piece, allow me to review and provide feedback. Use my feedback to refine how you replicate my voice and style for future responses.

Letâ€™s begin with Step 1. I will now share examples of my writing for analysis.
