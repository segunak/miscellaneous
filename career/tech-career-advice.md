# Tech Career Advice

![HelloThere](/images/hellothere-obiwan.gif)

This document is a collection of tech-related career advice that I, [Segun Akinyemi](https://segunakinyemi.com/), intend to update regularly (by the grace of God).

## Software Engineering

TBD.

### Alternative Job Titles

These are job titles that either mean the same thing or are incredibly similar to `Software Engineer` which should be considered when looking for positions. Different companies call the same thing different things.

## Product Management

This section is dedicated to `Product Management`, which is—at best—a nebulous job title. I—the [author](https://www.linkedin.com/in/segunakinyemi/) of this document—am a `Software Engineer`, but I work closely with PMs and have several in my group of friends and mentors. The PM world—where the `P` can mean Product, Program, or Project—is infamous for general ambiguity surrounding what precisely the difference is between those roles that all seem to require the same set of core [skills and competencies](/images/pm-skills.png). In this section, I'm bundling them together to provide advice applicable to any of those roles or their closely related alternatives.

### Alternative Job Titles

 I believe that someone interested in `Product Management`—and in possession of the requisite skills—would be fit for any of the job titles listed below, all of which are in the same [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) if not the same [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species).
